# Breast-Density-Classification
Code for the development of the Breast Density Classification Algorithm used in my Thesis. This code utilizes publicly available sample data.

Sample data can be found and downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/cbis-ddsm-breast-cancer-image-dataset

Before Running Code:
  1. Download the sample data set from the above kaggle webpage. 
  2. Place the jpeg folder found in the downloaded files into the project folder
  3. Install the required packages found in requirements.txt

Install the dependencies listed in environment.yml to a new environment. 

Use run.py to make changes to the pipeline and run the code.
