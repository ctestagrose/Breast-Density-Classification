# Breast-Density-Classification
Code for the development of the Breast Density Classification Algorithm used in my Thesis. This code utilizes publicly available sample data.

Sample data can be found and downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/cbis-ddsm-breast-cancer-image-dataset

Place the sample data folder "jpeg" in the project directory. 

Install the dependencies listed in environment.yml to a new environment. 

Use run.py to make changes to the pipeline and run the code.
